                        Vicor Corporation announces the opening of three new technical support centers in key global markets, expanding its presence in Europe and Asia.
                        The new facilities in Munich, Singapore, and Tokyo enhance local support capabilities and strengthen Vicor's commitment to providing world-class technical assistance to customers developing power solutions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Strategic Global Expansion</h2>
                    <p>
                        The expansion of technical support centers reflects Vicor's commitment to supporting customers throughout the design cycle, from initial concept through volume production.
                        The new locations were selected based on customer presence, market growth projections, and the need for localized technical expertise in power system design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Our expansion to Munich, Singapore, and Tokyo represents a significant investment in our ability to support customers where they are," said Jennifer Walsh, Director of Global Customer Support.
                        "Time zone alignment and cultural understanding enable more effective technical collaboration."
